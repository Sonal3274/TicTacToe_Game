# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is the code for standard Tic-Tac-Toe Game.

## Project Description 

Tic-Tac-Toe is a double-player game. Both the players are humans.
In this game, you can choose the grid size.

For example, the player chooses the 3x3 grid board.

The goal of this game is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row -
horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. 

The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols (marks) in a row - 
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and the other loses the game automatically.

Also, there is a possibility that the game might end with a tie and no one wins if no player is able
to get his/her symbols (marks) in a row.
